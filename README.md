# Calender-app

A basic calendar app developed using C programming



🚀**Project Overview:**

This is a calendar application built using C that displays the full year for any given input year. It calculates the first day of the year and accounts for leap years to adjust February’s days. The program prints each month with correctly aligned weekdays, showing dates under Sunday to Saturday columns. This project demonstrates date calculations, control structures, and formatted output in C programming.



✨**Key Features:**

 ✔ Displays the full calendar for any year entered by the user.

✔  Automatically calculates the first day of the year.

✔  Accounts for leap years and adjusts February accordingly.

✔  Shows each month with dates correctly aligned under the weekdays (Sunday to Saturday).

✔  Simple console-based interface with clear formatting for easy reading.




🛠️**Tecnical Architecture:**


✔ * **Programming Language:** C

✔ * **Core Logic:** Uses arithmetic calculations to determine the first day of the year and loops to iterate through months and days.

✔ * **Leap Year Handling:** Checks if the input year is a leap year to adjust February’s days.

✔ * **Data Structures:**


✔ * Arrays for storing month names and number of days in each month.

✔  * Integer variables for tracking weekdays, day counters, and loops.

✔ * **Output:** Console-based display with formatted printing to align dates under correct weekdays.

✔* **Flow:**


  1. Input year → 2. Check leap year → 3. Calculate first weekday → 4. Loop through months → 5. Print dates under correct weekdays.
